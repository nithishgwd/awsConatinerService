```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --region us-east-1 --stack-name my-eks-vpc-stack --template-url https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/cloudformation/2020-10-29/amazon-eks-vpc-private-subnets.yaml

```

The provided AWS CloudFormation template creates an Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with both public and private subnets. It's designed to be used with Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) clusters.

Here's an explanation of the template and how to use it:

1. **Parameters:** This section defines the input parameters that can be customized when creating the CloudFormation stack. These parameters include the VPC CIDR block and the CIDR blocks for public and private subnets.

2. **Metadata:** This section includes metadata for the CloudFormation stack, specifically for the AWS CloudFormation interface.

3. **Resources:** This section defines the AWS resources that will be created when the CloudFormation stack is launched. Here's a breakdown of the key resources:

   - **VPC:** Defines the main VPC resource with the specified CIDR block. It also enables DNS support and hostnames for the VPC.

   - **InternetGateway:** Creates an internet gateway, which allows resources in the VPC to connect to the internet.

   - **VPCGatewayAttachment:** Attaches the internet gateway to the VPC, allowing traffic to flow in and out.

   - **PublicRouteTable:** Creates a route table for the public subnets in the VPC.

   - **PrivateRouteTable01 and PrivateRouteTable02:** Create route tables for the private subnets in Availability Zone 1 and 2.

   - **PublicRoute:** Defines a default route in the public route table, which directs traffic to the internet via the internet gateway.

   - **PrivateRoute01 and PrivateRoute02:** Define default routes in the private route tables. These routes will later be associated with NAT gateways.

   - **NatGateway01 and NatGateway02:** Create NAT gateways for each public subnet. These are used for allowing private subnet instances to connect to the internet.

   - **NatGatewayEIP1 and NatGatewayEIP2:** Allocate Elastic IP addresses for the NAT gateways.

   - **PublicSubnet01 and PublicSubnet02:** Define the public subnets, including their availability zones and CIDR blocks.

   - **PrivateSubnet01 and PrivateSubnet02:** Define the private subnets, including their availability zones and CIDR blocks.

   - **PublicSubnet01RouteTableAssociation, PublicSubnet02RouteTableAssociation, PrivateSubnet01RouteTableAssociation, and PrivateSubnet02RouteTableAssociation:** Associate the subnets with their respective route tables.

   - **ControlPlaneSecurityGroup:** Defines a security group for cluster communication with worker nodes.

4. **Outputs:** This section defines the stack outputs. The template defines outputs for subnet IDs, security groups, and the VPC ID, which can be useful for other resources or configurations that depend on this VPC.

To use this CloudFormation template:

1. Save the template in a file with a `.yaml` or `.json` extension, e.g., `eks-vpc-template.yaml`.

2. Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to create a CloudFormation stack using this template.

   For example, using the AWS CLI:
   
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-eks-vpc-stack --template-body file://eks-vpc-template.yaml
   ```

This CloudFormation template will create the specified VPC with the defined subnets, route tables, and other resources, which can be useful for setting up an Amazon EKS cluster in a well-structured networking environment.
