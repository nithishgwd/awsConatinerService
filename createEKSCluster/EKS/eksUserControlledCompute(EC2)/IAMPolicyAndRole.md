IAM policies and IAM roles are two fundamental concepts in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), each serving distinct purposes:

1. **IAM Policy**:
   - An IAM policy is a document that defines permissions. It specifies what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources for what entities (users, groups, or roles).
   - Policies are attached to AWS identities (users, groups, or roles) to grant or restrict their access to AWS resources.
   - Policies can be inline (embedded within an identity) or managed separately as standalone JSON documents.
   - Use Case: Attach policies to IAM users, groups, or roles to define their access permissions. For example, you can create a policy that allows read access to a specific S3 bucket and attach it to an IAM user.

2. **IAM Role**:
   - An IAM role is an AWS identity that doesn't have any associated credentials (like username and password). Instead, it is assumed by other AWS entities, such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or even other AWS accounts.
   - Roles have policies attached to them to define what actions they can perform.
   - Roles often have a trust relationship with the entity that can assume them, specifying which AWS entities are allowed to assume the role.
   - Use Case: IAM roles are used when you want to grant temporary permissions to an AWS service or entity. For example, you can create a role with permissions to access an S3 bucket and then grant an EC2 instance permission to assume that role to access the S3 bucket securely.

In summary, IAM policies define permissions and are attached directly to users, groups, or roles. IAM roles are used for granting permissions to trusted AWS entities, and they can have policies attached to them. Roles are often used in scenarios where temporary access is needed or where you want to grant permissions to AWS services without storing credentials. Policies are more commonly used to manage permissions for individual users or groups.


You can create IAM policies, such as an S3 delete policy and an EBS admin policy, and then attach these policies to an IAM role. Once these policies are attached to the role, you can grant access to various AWS entities, including IAM users or EC2 instances, by associating them with the IAM role.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Create an IAM role and attach the S3 delete policy and EBS admin policy to that role.

2. Define a trust relationship in the role policy document to specify which AWS entities are allowed to assume the role. For example, if you want an EC2 instance to assume this role, the trust relationship should specify that.

3. If you want to grant IAM users access to these permissions, you can do this in one of two ways:

   - You can attach the IAM role directly to an IAM user. This allows the user to assume the role and inherit the permissions associated with it when needed.

   - You can also grant permissions to IAM users indirectly by allowing an EC2 instance to assume the role and then having the IAM users interact with that EC2 instance. This is often used when you want to grant temporary access to IAM users for tasks like data processing on EC2 instances.

4. If you want to grant EC2 instances access to these permissions, you can specify the role in the instance's launch configuration or user data. The EC2 instance will then assume the role and have the associated permissions.

So, yes, you are correct in your approach. By attaching the IAM role with the S3 delete and EBS admin policies to either IAM users or EC2 instances, you can control and manage their access to S3 and EBS resources according to your defined policies.
