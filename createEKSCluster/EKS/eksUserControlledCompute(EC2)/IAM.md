The configuration for an IAM user in Amazon EKS determines the permissions and access that the IAM user has within the EKS cluster. The IAM user can be granted access to manage and interact with different parts of the EKS environment, including the cluster itself, its nodes, and the pods running within the cluster.

Here's a breakdown of what can be configured for an IAM user in Amazon EKS:

1. **Cluster-Level Permissions**:
   - IAM users can be granted permissions to manage the EKS cluster itself. This includes actions like creating, updating, or deleting the EKS cluster and managing its configuration.

2. **Node Group Permissions**:
   - IAM users can be granted permissions to interact with the node groups and their associated EC2 instances. This allows users to manage the scaling, configuration, and lifecycle of the nodes in the cluster. Permissions can include actions such as scaling the node group, viewing node details, and interacting with the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) associated with the node group.

3. **Pod-Level Permissions**:
   - IAM users can be granted permissions to interact with and manage the pods running in the cluster. This includes the ability to create, modify, or delete pods, as well as access to pod logs and other Kubernetes resources.

The specific permissions an IAM user has are determined by the policies attached to the IAM user's role or user. These policies are defined in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and can be customized to grant the user the necessary permissions while following the principle of least privilege.

For example, an IAM user could have a policy that allows them to perform operations on the EKS cluster itself, another policy that grants access to manage the node groups, and potentially policies to interact with specific pods or namespaces. IAM policies are highly customizable and can be fine-tuned to meet the requirements of your organization's security and access control.

It's important to carefully design IAM policies to strike a balance between providing users with the access they need to perform their tasks and ensuring the security and integrity of your EKS cluster.
