The process of editing the `aws-auth` ConfigMap in Kubernetes and using OIDC (OpenID Connect) to manage user access are related but serve slightly different purposes in an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster.

1. **Editing the `aws-auth` ConfigMap:**
   - Editing the `aws-auth` ConfigMap allows you to define the mapping between AWS IAM roles and Kubernetes Service Accounts within your EKS cluster.
   - This is primarily used for granting AWS IAM roles permissions to perform actions within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - It doesn't directly relate to managing user access to your EKS cluster. Instead, it defines the roles that various components within the cluster can assume.

   - use case 
      Granting Applications Access to AWS Resources: You can map Kubernetes service accounts to AWS IAM roles. This allows applications running in your EKS cluster to assume AWS roles and interact with AWS services, such as reading from an S3 bucket or writing to a DynamoDB table. For example, a containerized application in EKS might need to access an S3 bucket to store or retrieve data. By defining the role mapping in aws-auth, you grant the application's service account the necessary permissions.

2. **OIDC (OpenID Connect) for User Access:**
   - OIDC integration in Amazon EKS allows you to manage user access to your Kubernetes cluster. It enables you to authenticate users via identity providers, such as AWS Cognito, and map them to Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) roles.
   - OIDC is used for managing human users' access to the cluster and doesn't necessarily relate to IAM roles for AWS services or components.
   - It's a way to provide authentication and authorization for actual users who need to interact with your Kubernetes cluster, for tasks like deploying applications or accessing resources.

   - use case 
      Fine-Grained Access Control: Once users are authenticated, you can map them to specific Kubernetes RBAC roles and role bindings. For example, you might map a group of users to a "developer" role that allows them to deploy applications but restricts access to sensitive cluster components. Another group could be mapped to an "admin" role with broader permissions for cluster management.

      - To enable and use AWS IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts on our EKS cluster, we must create & associate OIDC identity provider.
   
      # Template
      eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
         --region region-code \
         --cluster <cluter-name> \
         --approve


In summary, editing the `aws-auth` ConfigMap primarily deals with IAM role mappings for Kubernetes components and services (e.g., for AWS Lambda or other AWS services), while OIDC is a method for managing user access and authentication to the EKS cluster. The two approaches serve different use cases: `aws-auth` for service/component roles, and OIDC for user access. You may use both in your EKS cluster to cater to various authentication and authorization needs.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) provides a secure and flexible way to manage authentication and authorization for applications running in your EKS cluster. Here's an example scenario where OIDC can be valuable:

**Scenario**: You have a microservices-based application running in your EKS cluster, and you want to enable single sign-on (SSO) for your users, who may be employees, customers, or partners. Additionally, you want to grant fine-grained access control to different parts of your application based on the identity of the user.

In this scenario, OIDC can be beneficial:

1. **User Authentication**: OIDC allows you to integrate EKS with an external identity provider, such as Amazon Cognito, Okta, or an on-premises identity system. Users can log in to your application using their credentials from this identity provider.

2. **User Identity**: When a user authenticates through OIDC, EKS obtains information about the user's identity. This information can include user attributes like username, email, and groups.

3. **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Using the user's identity information, you can map these attributes to specific Kubernetes RBAC roles and permissions within your EKS cluster. This allows you to control who can access which parts of your application or services.

4. **Secure API Access**: If your application includes APIs, you can ensure that only authorized users or groups can access them. OIDC allows you to enforce authentication for API endpoints, ensuring that users are who they claim to be.

5. **Session Management**: OIDC often includes session management, allowing you to control user sessions and implement features like single sign-out (logout) and session timeouts.

6. **Auditing and Compliance**: OIDC integration can provide detailed logs and auditing capabilities, helping you meet compliance requirements and track user activity in your EKS cluster.

Overall, OIDC integration with EKS is useful when you need to handle user authentication and authorization in a flexible and secure manner, especially in scenarios where you have diverse user populations, complex access control requirements, and a need for SSO capabilities. It allows you to leverage external identity providers while maintaining control over access to your EKS services and resources.
